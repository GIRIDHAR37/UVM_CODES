Overview of the Implementation
Top Module:

You defined a top module that serves as the entry point for your testbench. Within this module, you called run_test("tlm_base_test"), which initiates the execution of your defined test class.
Test Class (tlm_base_test):

You created a test class that extends uvm_test. In the build_phase, you instantiated the tlm_agent component, which encapsulates the producer and consumer logic. This phase is crucial for setting up the necessary components of your test environment.
In the end_of_elaboration_phase, you used uvm_top.print_topology() to display the hierarchy of the UVM components, providing visibility into the structure of your simulation.
Agent Class (tlm_agent):

You implemented an agent class that serves as the interface between the producer and consumer. The build_phase creates instances of tlm_producer and tlm_consumer, effectively establishing the two ends of your communication channel.
In the connect_phase, you connected the producer's put_port to the consumer's put_imp, establishing the communication link necessary for transferring transactions.
Transaction Class (tlm_tx):

You defined a transaction class that extends uvm_sequence_item. This class contains the transaction fields, including data, addr, and wr_rd, which represent the essential information being transferred. You included randomization for these fields, enabling the generation of diverse transaction data.
Producer Class (tlm_producer):

You created a producer component that generates transactions and sends them to the consumer through a blocking put port (uvm_blocking_put_port). In the run_phase, you implemented a loop that generates and sends multiple randomized transactions to the consumer, demonstrating how the producer actively participates in the communication process.
Consumer Class (tlm_consumer):

You implemented a consumer component that receives transactions from the producer. The consumer has a method (put) to handle incoming transactions. In your implementation, the consumer prints the received transaction data, allowing you to observe the communication flow and verify that transactions are being received correctly.
Tools Used
Siemens QuestaSim 2023.0.3: You used this advanced simulation tool to execute your SystemVerilog code. QuestaSim is known for its support of UVM and TLM, providing powerful capabilities for functional verification and simulation of complex designs. Its features enable efficient simulation, debugging, and performance analysis.

Gvim Text Editor: For editing your SystemVerilog code, you utilized Gvim, a powerful text editor that provides a user-friendly interface and support for syntax highlighting and editing features. Gvim is particularly useful for coding in environments that require rapid modifications and testing, as it integrates well with version control and project management tools.
